# syllable-counting
Simple java program which attempts to count the number of syllables in an input word.
Base rules for algorithm are from this blog: http://jzimba.blogspot.com/2017/07/an-algorithm-for-counting-syllables.html

Further additions and improvements to the algorithm have been added by myself.

Currently, in testing program is approximately 90% accurate in calculating the number of syllables in english words.

The purpose of this program isn’t to be 100% accurate in calculating the number of syllables in a word. It more serves as an exercise for myself in recognizing rules in everyday language that I haven’t considered before, and then further, deciding how to best implement them in a code format.
